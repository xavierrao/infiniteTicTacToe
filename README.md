Infinite Tic Tac Toe is based off the GiiKER Tic Tac Toe Bolt Game.

Like Tic-Tac-Toe, you have to place 3 of your mark in a line, whether it be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Unlike Tic-Tac-Toe, you can only have 3 marks on the grid at a time. This means that when you place your 4th mark, your 1st mark disappears and so on. You cannot place your 4th mark in the same space as your 1st mark. After each player has placed 3 marks, one mark will turn red to indicate that it is the one to disappear. That will happen until the game ends. Good luck and have fun!
